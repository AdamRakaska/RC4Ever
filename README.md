# RC4Ever
RC4 stream cipher variants for hashing, CBC, visualizing how it works, or just general encryption.

Includes 2 variants: 
1) A simple table with a method to visualize the permutation state of the table and the avalanche effect as a bitmap
2) A more serious attempt at a secure encryption scheme.

**NOTE: PROBABLY NOT ACTUALLY SECURE, SO DO NOT TRUST IT!**

This is the base project from which other projects currently in progress are cloned from.
